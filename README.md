mirror-displays
===============

A Mac app and command-line tool for fiddling with display mirroring: on/off/toggle

```
usage: mirror [option]	Passing more than one option produces undefined behavior.
  -h	        Print this usage and exit.
  -t	        Toggle mirroring (default behavior)
  -on	        Turn Mirroring On
  -off	        Turn Mirroring Off
  -q	        Query the Mirroring state and print "on" or "off" to stdout
```
